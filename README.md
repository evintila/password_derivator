# password_derivator

Derive 32 character secure passwords for your accounts.
The passwords are not stored anywhere and no state is kept. You just have to remember one master password (which is not stored either).
Fill out the fields, press Derive, press Copy and you have your 32 character password in the clipboard.

Example:
Site: www.mozilla.org
Username: john.doe
Master Password: <-- put here the master password (the only one that you need to remember for all accounts)
Counter: <-- fill this only if you want to change the password for this account
Press Derive, press Copy, and you have a password of the form "QzXP7h8WCbGFp6fDGNo9DcV2RljwPqHULWi+ZS8yCGc" in your clipboard!

Implemented as a Firefox Plugin (password-derivator) and as a stand-alone Linux tool.
